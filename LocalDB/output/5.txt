Alleged irregularities in a contract for the construction of garages and a 
parking area for Air Traffic Control Services at Pristina Airport and in an annex 
agreement for the supply of new offices, training room and maintenance 
garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service (Case 0276/04)  
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial 
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered 
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and 
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina 
International Airport. 
 
2. There are four specific allegations in this report of investigation: 
• Extra work to the value of €25,935.74 was added to the main contract without 
any supporting documentation; 
• The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA authorised the Annex 
Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her 
authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated 
from the normal procurement procedure; 
• Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex agreement without 
any supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works 
or appropriate authorisation. 
• The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA failed to secure funding 
approval prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agreement.

III. METHODOLOGY 
 
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on 
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators 
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons 
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by 
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, 
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand. 
 
 
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under 
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal 
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period 
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the 
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the 
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999. 
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned 
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport. 
 
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina 
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport 
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport 
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs.  DOTI Official 1 left 
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an 
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, 
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. 
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from a 
member state’s armed forces specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 
and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm 
 

 
3 
6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed 
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional 
Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under 
him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) 
Official 1. 
 
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been 
under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under 
ICAO regulations. 
 
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to 
the following contract have been examined. 
 
 
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS  
 
9. This report relates to Contract Ref ATCS/PA/COC W 02-02 for the construction of 
garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) at the Pristina 
Airport. It also deals with a further single source contract Annex Agreement Ref 
ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and 
maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service. The value of the main 
contract was €263,093  and the Annex Agreement €33,927 . 
 
Allegation 1 
(Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to the main contract for the 
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without 
any supporting documentation detailing the nature of the extra works or appropriate 
authorisation) 
 
10. A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002 indicates that following an 
evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construction of garages and a parking 
area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded to a the company in Pristina. A 
bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurement Officer at Pristina Airport 
dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the 
lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies selected for further evaluation.  
 
11. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed with the Vendor by ATCS at 
Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002.  
 
12. A schedule of payments for the main contract indicates that a sum of €25, 935.74 
was added to the cost of the contract. However, there are no documents in the 
contract file indicating the nature of the extra works or under what procedure they 
were authorised.  
 
13. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Divisional Manager stated that 
he/she would have expected to see a schedule of extra works in the contract file. 
However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore could not state to what the extra 
works related or under what procedure they were authorised. 
 
14. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of the works and the whereabouts 
of supporting documentation, stated that the request for the extra expenditure 
came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure there was a justification 

 
4 
from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the 
meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport. 
 
15. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided ITF Investigators an 
explanation for the extra work and produced a spreadsheet detailing how the 
figures had been determined. 
 
16. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill 
of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the 
evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduction in the price of the contract 
from €263,093 to €260,726.81. 
 
17. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attributable to this arithmetical error from 
the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a review of the specifications. The 
review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€1941.62 more than the stated 
contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities. 
 
18. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the 
specification review work, amounting to the difference between the original 
contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice price of €289,028.74, giving a 
total of €25,935.57 for extra work. 
 
19. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Official 2 in a further meeting with 
the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also confirmed that the extra work 
had not been recorded in written form, as it followed a visit to the construction site 
by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1.  
 
20. In summary, there are no documentary records to support the extra works. The 
only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears to be a 
signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €25,935.74 for 
extra works.  
 
Allegation 2 
(The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the 
fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation limit of €25, 000 to sign and 
approve a contract which deviated from the normal procurement procedure under 
Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public 
Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds); 
and 
Allegation 3 
(Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex Agreement without any 
supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works or 
appropriate authorisation) 
 
21. A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Divisional Manager dated 21 
January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7 January 2003, indicates 
that an urgent request was made for construction of a fire-fighters office and 
maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland taking over from Italy as “Lead 
Nation” in March 2003.  
 
22. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was signed with the Vendor for 
construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices on 7 February 2003, 

 
5 
supported by a justification from the Divisional Manager also dated 7 February 
2003.  
 
23. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 relating to the annex agreement 
indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cost of the contract. However, 
there are no documents in the contract file indicating the nature of the extra 
works or under what procedure they were authorised.  
 
24. When asked about the extra payment in interview, the Divisional Manager 
indicated that from the documents presented to him/her (specifically the contract 
file) he/she could not say what the extra works were. He/she added that without 
looking at the works covered by the contract he/she could not know whether or 
not there was any provision for extra expenditure. 
 
25. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra payment in interview stated that 
he/she would have to check airport administration records and provide this 
information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF 
at which he/she indicated that the extra work related to a request from KFOR for 
a stair rail and the creation of a storage space under the stairs of the training 
offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, together with office partitioning for 
the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/she produced a copy of a 
manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 September 2004, drawn up by the 
Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carried out. This indicates that 
there was no supporting documentation for the extra work when it was carried 
out. The only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears 
to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €1,390 for 
extra works.  
 
Allegation 4 
(It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval prior to 
authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office 
and maintenance offices) 
 
26. A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 2003 shows that the Divisional 
Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the 
contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €25,000. In addition, the 
document indicates that the work had already been completed by the time that 
financial approval was sought for the expenditure. 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
 
27. There is no supporting documentation or appropriate authorisation for the extra 
works in the sum of €25,935.74 arising from the main contract for the 
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services. This is 
contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on 
Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds. 
 
28.  The same is applicable to the extra works in the sum of €1,390 relating to the 
Annex Agreement for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance 
offices. This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative 
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget 
Funds. 

 
6 
 
29. In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed 
in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of 
€25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated from the normal 
procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative 
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget 
Fund. 
 
30. Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval 
prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agreement to construct a fire-
fighters office and maintenance offices. This is contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK 
Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo 
Consolidated Budget Funds.   
 
31. In mitigation, the construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices do 
appear to have been required as a matter of urgency. 
 
 
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
32. The ITF recommends the following; 
 
Given that the Divisional Manager has left the Mission and cannot be sanctioned for 
his/her actions, it is recommended that UNMIK (Pillar IV) should place a copy of this 
report on his/her personnel file for future reference. (IV04/276/01) 
 
It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropriate action against ATCS 
Official 2 as the official having responsibility for the ATCS for his/her failure to ensure 
that the extra work was adequately documented and authorised. (IV04/277/02)

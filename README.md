# Profiler Tool

## Introduction  
Profiler Tool is a web application designed for entity extraction and profiling from uploaded PDF files. It allows users to upload PDFs, extract named entities, visualize relationships in a network graph, and perform entity-based searches.

This tool utilizes **Flask** for the backend, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **Vue.js** for the frontend. Additionally, **D3.js** is used for network graph visualization.

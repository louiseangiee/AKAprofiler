Case 285/04  
       
 
Pristina Airport – Possible administrative irregula rity regarding tender procedures involving 
Vendor 1 and Vendor 2  
 
 
Allegation 
Two companies with the same owner took part at leas t three times in the same Airport tenders. 
 
Background Information 
The Kosovo citizen, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Represent ative, is the owner and Director of the 
Pristina-based Vendor 1 and also a 51% shareholder of the Pristina-Ljubljana-based company 
Vendor 2. Both companies have their residences at t he same address in Pristina. 
 
Both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 submitted three times in  2003 for the same tenders:  
 
1. Supply and Mounting of Sonic System in the Fire Sta tion Building. Winner was Vendor 
2 with €1,530 followed by Vendor 1 with €1,620. The  third company, Vendor 3, did not 
provide a price offer. 
2. Cabling of Flat Display Information System (FIDS). Winner was Vendor 1 with €15,919 
followed by Vendor 2 with €19,248.70. The other two  competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 
4, offered prices of Euro 19,702 and Euro 21,045. 
3. Purchase and fixing of Cramer Antenna. Winner was a gain Vendor 1 with €3,627.99 
followed by Vendor 2 with €3,921. The other two com petitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 4, 
offered prices of €4,278 and €4,670. 
 
Investigative details 
4. In his/her interviews conducted on 31 st August and 14 th  September 2004, Vendor 1 and 
Vendor 2 Representative admitted that the fact that  both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 took part 
together in three Airport tenders put other competi tors at a disadvantage, but alleged both 
companies have never exchanged information with reg ard to the price offers.   2  
  
There were doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 a nd Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for 
the three tenders. The ITF investigation, with supp ort from the Kosovo Organised Crime Bureau 
(KOCB), has found no reference with regard to the e xistence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4 
in Pristina. The alleged company Vendor 3 was found  to be a supermarket located in Prizren.  
 
The above-mentioned facts are already part of the I TF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the 
International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justic e, in October 2004. On 1 December 2004, 
the ITF contacted the International Prosecutor for a legal assessment of this case. Although this 
case would clearly be a breach of Economic Law, the re is no applicable law in Kosovo for the 
time being. 
  
Conclusions 
The entire matter has to be seen as an administrati ve irregularity. It is obvious that international 
procurement rules and economic crime law had been b reached but the Procurement Regulation 
that was in force at that time – Financial Agreemen t 1999/2 – does not indicate cases like 
described before and Kosovo does not have yet any E conomic Law. 
 
As agreed with the International Prosecutor, a copy  of the Final Report will be provided for him 
as background information related to the ITF case n o. 286/04. 
 
 
Recommendations 
It is recommended that UNMIK, and in particular, the  KTA undertake the following actions: 
Recommendation 1: The Airport staff responsible for  procurement activity should receive 
adequate training in the handling of procurement ma tters and to adhere to all applicable 
Procurement Regulations. 
Recommendation 2: The Airport staff responsible for  procurement activity has to ensure a fair 
competition and pay more attention to check the bac kground of the bidding companies.

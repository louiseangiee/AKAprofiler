 1This is a report dealing with the ma tters raised (1) in the audit report 
dated 26 January 2006 PD/155/02 an d (2) raised in other referrals 
concerning Mr. Walter Cabrera, pr ocurement officer, Headquarters 
Procurement Section, at relevant times.  
 
 The following sets forth the finding s of the Procurement Task Force 
concerning United Nations staff me mber Walter Cabrera.     
 
 INTRODUCTION  
 
 The Procurement Task Force wa s created on January 12, 2006 to 
address all procurement matt ers referred to the Office of Internal Oversight 
Services (OIOS).  The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived 
problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee 
into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC),  and the arrest and conviction of UN 
procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev.  
            Under its Terms of Ref erence, the Task Force operates as part of 
OIOS, and reports directly to the Unde r Secretary General of OIOS.   The 
remit of the Task Force is to inve stigate all open and pending procurement 
cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises, 
procurement staff, and vendors doing  business with the United Nations 
(hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”).  The mandate of the Task Force also 
includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but 
it is nevertheless determined that furthe r investigative effort is warranted.   
 
The Task Force’s investigations ha ve also focused upon a myriad of 
individuals and vendors doing business w ith the Organization.  Some of 
these matters are particularly complex a nd span significant periods of time.  
Since its inception, more than 200 matt ers, involving numerous procurement 
cases in various UN Missions and UN He adquarters have been referred to 
the Task Force.   The Task Force w ill report on matters individually. The 
Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff 
members placed on special  leave with pay. 
 
   The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit 
findings of January 2006 concerning Wa lter Cabrera, a United Nations 
procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE

 2Force through a separate referral.    Fi rst, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have 
improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had 
been granted in favor of the vendor , Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a 
contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official 
award of the contract.  Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera 
engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in 
substantial contracts ultimately awar ded to the firm Telecommunications 
Consultants of India (TCIL).  Th e audit report found significant fraud 
indicators in connection with the procur ement exercises in these contracts, a 
conclusion with which the Task Force agrees.  (The Task Force will report 
on these issues in much more detail in  a subsequent report addressing related 
matters).  However, the focus of this  report is upon the conduct of Mr. 
Cabrera individually, and whether Mr . Cabrera acted improperly in his 
participation in these matters.   
 
 APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS 
 
 This matter is examined within th e confines of the applicable United 
Nations regulations and rules, a nd in particular, the following: 
  Rule 1.2(b) which requires Staff Memb ers to “uphold the highest standards 
of efficiency, competence, and integrity.” The regula tions define the concept 
of integrity to include, but not limit ed to, “probity, impartiality, fairness, 
honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting thei r work and status.”   
 
Rule 1.2(i) which requires that Sta ff members “shall exercise the utmost 
discretion with regard to all matters of official business.  They shall not 
communicate to any Government, en tity, person or any other source any 
information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has been  made public, except as appropriate 
in the normal course of their duties or  by authorization of the Secretary-
General.”   
 METHODOLOGY 
 
 The Task Force has examined the di scussion and findings in the audit 
report, and spoken with both the auditors  responsible for the matter, and, on 
several occasions, Mr. Cabrera.  The Ta sk Force has examin ed the file from OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 3the procurement department (“PD”) in connection with the Thunderbird 
matter, and the TCIL contracts. Howeve r, substantial portions of the files 
concerning both of these cases were f ound to be missing.  Nonetheless, the 
Task Force has examined relevant email communication, electronically 
stored records, and hard copy documen ts received through a variety of 
sources.  The Task Force has spoken w ith the officials in DPKO responsible 
for requisition of the items underlying the contracts at issue, and other United Nations procurement officer s involved in these matters. 
 
           With regard to the TCIL contracts, the investigation of Mr. Cabrera’s 
involvement in the laptop procuremen t, more fully discussed below, has 
faced a number of significant ch allenges including the procurement 
department’s policy of short term retention of cancelled bids and the 
turnover and movement of staff.  Neve rtheless, forensic data recovery has 
been an important tool utilized to  examine the circumstances and the 
relevant communication on the issue.  In connection with the Thunderbird 
matter, significant portions of the Thunderb ird file are also missing.  In that 
case as well, the Task Force has been able  to use forensic resources to gather 
significant relevant information and evidence.  
 DISCUSSION 
   
Notice of the Award to Thunderbird LLC
  
 
The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in 
dispute.  In May, 2002, Thunder bird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr. 
Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, ha d submitted an application in support 
of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit 
proposals on upcoming UN contracts.  In July, 2002, after successfully being 
registered by PD, Thunderbird, throug h Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal 
for the supply of engineering manpower  to various UN Missions in response 
to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department.  Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya 
Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the 
Headquarters Committee on Contracts (H CC) in favor of the award to 
Thunderbird.  The matter had not been  assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late 
December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that 
time.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 4However, after the presentati on by Mr. Bahel to the HCC on 4 
September 2002, the HCC granted exped ited approval for an extension of 
the existing contract being performed at the time by IECS-IRCON (“IECS”), 
and a subsequent award to Thunderbird to replace IECS.  The circumstances 
surrounding the request fo r expedited approval and the basis for it are not 
fully clear.  There is no record of such  a request, and there is no reference to 
any such request in the minutes of th e HCC.    Mr. Cabrera has denied 
making the request, and there is no information in the procurement 
department’s files on the issue or to suggest Mr. Cabrera made the request.  
However, it is clear that the requ est is required to come from the 
procurement department, either the o fficer making the presentation, or the 
supervisor.  The line officer who atte nded the HCC meeting with Mr. Bahel 
has denied making the request at any time, and there is not evidence to 
suggest that she did.  
 
  However, the investigation ha s revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal 
involvement in ensuring that the ve ndor, Thunderbird, received advanced 
notice of the likely award.  Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also 
the only individual associated with th e request for expedited approval in a 
position to seek it.  The need for expe dited approval for Thunderbird in the 
first instance and the effort to notify T hunderbird quickly of a likely award is 
questionable in light of the fact that  in the same HCC meeting the current 
vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two 
months, and that Thunderbird had fa iled to submit audited financial 
statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task .  
(However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms).    Thus, the 
basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is 
problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application 
was still not yet complete.  Curiously , there is no request for advanced 
notification to IECS of the exped ited approval of their extension. 
 
  While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet 
finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting 
expedited approval for both  the continuation of the current contractor, and 
for the replacement, Thunderbird.  The circumstances surrounding the 
creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first 
instance are troubling, and are a con tinued subject of the Task Force’s 
investigation.  However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

 5the Task Force which demons trates Mr. Cabrera particip ated in this aspect of 
the matter. 
  After the HCC presentation, Mr. Ba hel, who was scheduled to leave 
New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a 
UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cab rera prior to his departure.  In 
this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to  them.  According to Mr. Cabrera, 
he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to 
Thunderbird, but was able to give ve rbal notification of the HCC’s action 
based upon the document issued by the HC C.   Mr. Cabrera’s understanding 
that this action was permissible was ba sed upon the fact that his supervisor, 
Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at 
the time.   At the direction of Mr. Ba hel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr. 
Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recomme nded that the contract be awarded 
to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird woul d likely receive the contract.   Mr. 
Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an 
LOI prior to receiving the approved H CC minutes and formal award of the 
contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to the Organization through his attorney ma terially differs, however the Task 
Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible). 
 
   Mr. Cabrera concedes that he pr ovided notice to Nishan Kohli at the 
express direction of Mr. Bahel afte r the HCC had issued a notice of 
expedited approval.   According to Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Bahel left instructions 
to await a copy of the approval in hi s inbox in the procurement office.  
Further, according to Mr. Cabrera, Mr . Bahel explained to Mr. Cabrera that 
he would be out of the office and reque sted that Mr. Cabrera should retrieve 
the document and notify the vendor of  the likely award.  Mr. Cabrera 
acknowledges that he followed the direc tion, and in the course of contact 
with Mr. Kohli, he pr ovided the notification. 
 While the salient facts as they relate  to Mr. Cabrera set forth above are 
not in dispute, the propriety of his ac tions has been questioned.  The Task 
Force has examined whether Mr. Cabrer a’s conduct ran afoul of any relevant 
United Nations regulations or rules, particularly the prohibition against 
improper communication of propriety information to those outside of the 
Organization not authorized to receive it (Regulation 1.2(i)), the prohibitions OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 6against favoring particular vendors in bidding exercises, and the 
procurement rules in gene ral.  Mr. Cabrera’s cont ention in defense of his 
actions is that in instances in which the HCC grants expedited approval, and 
thereafter issues the approval form, no tification to the vendor that an award 
is likely does not contravene existing rules. 
 
  The Task Force has not been  able to identify any precise 
procurement rule on this point in ex istence at this time and requests of 
numerous departments in the Organizati on have failed to produce anything 
relevant.  Hence, there does not seem  to be any clear directive either 
permitting or prohibiting such action.  Fu rther, several witnesses within the 
Organization with significant experi ence in procurement matters have 
informed the Task Force that in circ umstances in which expedited approval 
is sought, it is not improper to provi de such conditional notice to allow a 
contractor to prepare to comply with its obligations under the contract and 
allow them to adequately prepare themselv es to perform in a timely fashion.   
While it is certainly questionable whethe r in this instance notice of expedited 
approval was truly exigent in light of the fact that the vendor was not going 
to perform under the contract for tw o months and Thunderbird had yet to 
submit audited financial statements, th ere is no evidence that suggests Mr. 
Cabrera shared responsibility for the re quest in the first instance, or was 
otherwise aware of the unexplained circumstances of the request for 
expedited approval and the basis for it.  
 
 Therefore, in light of the fore going, and the absence of a clear 
regulation to the contrary demonstra ting that Mr. Cabrera should have 
known his actions were improper, th e notification Mr. Cabrera provided 
cannot form the basis of an adverse finding against him. 
 The TCIL Contracts
 
 
 The contracts awarded to the firm  Telecommunication Consultants of 
India (TCIL) have been the subject of extensive examination by the Task 
Force.  Again, while these matters  will be discussed in much more 
exhaustive and comprehensive detail in  a subsequent report, they are 
addressed herein only as they relate to Mr. Cabrera.     OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 7 The Task Force has exam ined the five contracts set forth in Table 11 
of the audit report AP2005/600/20 of Ja nuary 19, 2006, at paragraph 123.  
While the Task Force acknowledges that the auditors quite correctly found 
that strong indications of fraud existed in connection with these contracts, an 
examination of Mr. Cabrera’s role in  these matters has not resulted in 
evidence of improper conduct on his part.    The investigation has found that 
Mr. Cabrera was not involved in the bidding procedures in these matters, with the exception of one contract.   Wh ile an extensive discussion of all of 
these cases is therefore unnecessary, an  analysis of Case #5, PD/155/02, the 
laptop computers, requires discussion as  Mr. Cabrera was the case officer. 
 
 In this matter, the audit report f ound at paragraph 12 5 that “[t]here 
were indications that Walter Cabrera distorted communication to DPKO for 
the purpose of canceling the initial bid where TCIL was not the lowest 
bidder, and the Compaq brand of co mputers offered by TCIL was not going 
to be selected as a standardized bra nd.  TCIL won the replacement bid.”   
 
 In addressing this issue, some background is necessary.  First, it 
should be noted that the procurement f ile in this matter was found to be 
incomplete, missing documents and releva nt information.  The Task Force 
was able to identify more details as a re sult of forensic analysis of electronic 
media.  However, it cannot be  said that the Task For ce is comfortable that all 
information involving this matter has been gathered.  That said, the Task 
Force was able to reconstruct the follo wing facts concerning this matter from 
various documents and searches of el ectronic media, and discussions with 
relevant parties.     
In February, 2002, DPKO Communica tions and Technology Services 
Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop 
computers.  Mr. Cabrera was the proc urement officer in the procurement 
department (PD) assigned to this matte r.  The Chief of CITS communicated 
his request to PD, and on February 25,  2002 an expression of interest was 
issued by PD.   An invitation to bi d followed on April 15, 2002 which was 
transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries.  
 
            CITS advised PD th at they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq” 
based on ITSD standards for desktop com puters.  On the other hand, PD and 
the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 8process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and 
NEC to the list.  In a subsequent ex change of emails between PD and the 
requisitioner (CITS and IT SD), CITS continued to assert that they sought 
only the three major brands of com puters to avoid “inferior products,” 
laptops from “questionable manufact urers,” “clones” and “home built 
computers.”  Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to 
expanding the field to include other ma jor brands of computer manufacturers 
who were recognized industry leaders.  As a result, on April 24, 2002, the 
case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the 
vendors correcting the anticipated qua ntity of the computers sought, and 
clarifying that that only “Compaq, De ll, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and 
NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation. 
  On May 15, 2002 the bids were  read publicly.  La Cresta 
Communications of California submitted the lowest priced bid based upon a 
Pentium III Toshiba model.  TCIL wa s the next lowest bidder offering a 
Compaq model, followed by Dell, and then SSDI with  an IBM, and finally 
Manchester Technologies offering a Fu jitsu model.  On May 30, 2002, Mr. 
Cabrera notified La Cresta that th e company needed to resubmit the 
specifications for the Toshiba model th ey were offering as the table of 
compliance with the bid technical term s was absent and specification pages 
from La Cresta’s submission were contrary to the proper format.  
Nevertheless, Mr. Cabrera allowed La Cresta to resubmit the pages.    
 
 In its response, La Cresta informed PD that Toshiba was 
discontinuing the Pentium III model offered in its original submission, but that they would upgrade the model propos ed to a Pentium IV at no extra cost 
to the Organization.  La Cresta in formed PD that because Toshiba was 
discontinuing the Pentium III model, they therefore could not provide the anticipated quantity of Pentium III laptops  called for in the RFP.  However, 
La Cresta informed PD of its ability to fill the order for the guaranteed 
quantity with the currently proposed m odel and of its readiness to fill the 
remainder with an upgraded model at no extra cost.  
            The investigation has re vealed that Mr. Cabrera  forwarded to CITS, 
by email, La Cresta’s updated offe r of an upgraded model. Email 
communication reflects that Mr. Cabrer a’s dialogue with DPKO continued 
with respect to La Cresta’s offe r.  The Task Force has expended OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 9considerable effort to reconstruct the sequence of events that followed. A 
three week lapse existed be tween the time of the find ing that La Cresta was 
determined to be compliant, and the initi ation of the re-bidding exercise. In 
the interim period, email corres pondence confirms that DPKO found 
LaCresta to be technically compliant ev en after the offer of an upgrade. Mr. 
Cabrera was further in the midst of pr eparing the presentation to the HCC.  
  
            Procurement  Department  officials concede that at this point there 
was no further issue and there was no jus tification not to award the contract 
to LaCresta.  Indeed, no justification is  provided to La Cresta, or found in 
the file.  It seems that La Cresta  was not formally informed of the 
cancellation. (Typically the case offi cer maintains the responsibility for 
communicating the cancellation to the ve ndor.)  In this case, there is no 
correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying 
them of the cancellation.  A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversa tions with PD in this interim period, 
it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an 
“issue” with LaCresta’s submission.  According to the official, the 
Procurement Department suggested a re -bid because of a “technicality.”  
While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a 
commercial one it is only within PD’s  prerogative to cancel the bid on the 
basis of commercial non-compliance.  This  explanation is not persuasive as 
there was no commercial or technical issu e with LaCresta’s bid.  DPKO had 
found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder.  Mr. 
Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffe red by PD to the DPKO official is 
not sound, but takes issue with a ny claim participation by him in the 
exchange or decision.  
               Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was 
issued.  The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the 
identity of the individual(s) who s ought it.  The Task Force has not 
identified any evidence to support a fi nding that Mr. Cabrera was involved 
in the decision and the documents demons trate that Mr. Cabrera continued to 
maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerni ng its requests.  Further, the Task 
Force has not identified evidence whic h suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to 
cancel the bid, and then seek  a re-bidding exercise.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 10The investigation has revealed howev er that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor, 
Sanjaya Bahel, was intimat ely involved in the matter, and interjected himself 
in it, communicating with ITSD offici als and DPKO officials.  The DPKO 
official referred to above stated that he had conversations with Mr. Bahel in 
which Mr. Bahel confirmed that PD was of the view that there was a 
technical issue with LaCresta’s bid,  and there should be a new bidding 
exercise. 
 
The proposal was re-bid in early July.  The supplemental ITB 
ultimately limited the solicitation to th e three brands requested by CITS.  
The ITB was based upon the upgraded speci fications, the Pentium IV model.  
Ten companies responded, and two companies, TCIL  and Danoffice, were 
the most competitive both offering the same Compaq model. TCIL offered 
the lowest price, followed by Danoffice.   Of the initial bidders, TCIL was 
the only company to offer a lower price for the computer model it offered.  
All other vendors raised their prices fro m the initial bid.  Although La Cresta 
offered a Compaq brand, and the s econd lowest bid, the model it was 
offering was inferior to the models offered by TCIL and Danoffice, and was 
in fact determined by CITS to be non-compliant.    On July 18, 2002, Sanjaya Bahe l, the Officer in Charge of 
Procurement at the time, recommended the award to TCIL for a systems 
contract in the amount of US$5,340,000.  In the presentation of the matter to 
the HCC, officials questioned the basi s for limiting the bidding exercise to 
the three specified brands and intimated  that the PD violated UN rules and 
regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after 
the event describes a circumstance in  which DPKO officials are questioned 
about the limitation of the re-solicitati on to the three preferred brands.  The 
HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee 
would have recommended that a re-bi dding exercise be conducted inviting 
all brands of laptops that met the UN ’s requirement.”  Nevertheless, the 
proposed contract award to TCIL wa s ultimately approved, and signed.  
       The cancellation of the first bid, and the invitation for vendors to 
re-submit further bids in light of the cancellation, allowe d the other vendors 
a second opportunity to bid on the laptop contract.  While it is unclear what 
precipitated this action, the re-bidding ex ercise is questionable in light of the 
fact that LaCresta was held to be technically compliant and offered the OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE  
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA  
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 11lowest bid.  On that basi s, it appears that they s hould have been awarded the 
contract in the absence of objecti on by the requisitioner.  Mr. Cabrera 
concedes that this is the case.   Neve rtheless, there is a lack of evidence in 
possession of the Task Force that Mr. Ca brera was a factor in causing the re-
bidding exercise.  Indeed, he did not have the authority to do it, and past 
practice suggests that such a decision could only come from a supervisor.   
As such, the Task Force’s investiga tion cannot conclude that Mr. Cabrera 
engaged in this act to favor TCIL, not withstanding the fact that cancellation 
of the initial bid and the re-bidding exercise allowed TCIL, and the other 
vendors, a second opportunity for the contract.   
  CONCLUSION  
 
 Based upon the foregoing, the Task Force’s investigation has been 
unable to identify a sufficient basis to support a finding that procurement 
officer Walter Cabrera acted in viola tion UN rules and regulations of the 
Organization in connection with 1) his involvement in the Thunderbird 
matter in 2002, and 2) his participa tion in the TCIL contracts, and in 
particular the laptop contract , which were the subject of the audit report.

parking area for Air Traffic Control Services at Pr istina Airport and in an annex 
agreement for the supply of new offices, training r oom and maintenance 
garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service ( Case 0276/04 )  
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial 
statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered 
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and 
irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina 
International Airport. 
 
2. There are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation: 
• Extra work to the value of €25,935.74 was added to  the main contract without

Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her 
authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated 
from the normal procurement procedure; 
• Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the  Annex agreement without 
any supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works 
or appropriate authorisation. 
• The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA  failed to secure funding 
approval prior to authorising expenditure for the a nnex agreement.

III. METHODOLOGY 
 
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on 
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators 
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons 
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by 
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV, 
which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand. 
 
 
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under 
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal 
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period 
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the 
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the 
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution 
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999. 
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned 
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport. 
 
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina 
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport 
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport 
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left 
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an 
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations, 
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001. 
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from a 
member state’s armed forces specifically Airport En gineer I, Airport Engineer 2 
and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant  from the Consulting Firm 
  3 6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed 
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional 
Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under 
him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) 
Official 1. 
 
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been 
under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under 
ICAO regulations. 
 
8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to 
the following contract have been examined. 
 
 
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS  
 
9. This report relates to Contract Ref ATCS/PA/COC W 02-02 for the construction of 
garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) at the Pristina 
Airport. It also deals with a further single source  contract Annex Agreement Ref 
ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and 
maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Ser vice. The value of the main 
contract was €263,093  and the Annex Agreement €33, 927 . 
 
Allegation 1 
(Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to  the main contract for the 
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without 
any supporting documentation detailing the nature o f the extra works or appropriate 
authorisation) 
 
10. A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002  indicates that following an 
evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construct ion of garages and a parking 
area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded t o a the company in Pristina. A 
bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurem ent Officer at Pristina Airport 
dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the 
lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies sele cted for further evaluation.  
 
11. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed w ith the Vendor by ATCS at 
Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002.  
 
12. A schedule of payments for the main contract in dicates that a sum of €25, 935.74 
was added to the cost of the contract. However, the re are no documents in the 
contract file indicating the nature of the extra wo rks or under what procedure they 
were authorised.  
 
13. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Div isional Manager stated that 
he/she would have expected to see a schedule of ext ra works in the contract file. 
However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore c ould not state to what the extra 
works related or under what procedure they were aut horised. 
 
14. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of  the works and the whereabouts 
of supporting documentation, stated that the reques t for the extra expenditure 
came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure t here was a justification  4 from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the 
meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport. 
 
15. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided I TF Investigators an 
explanation for the extra work and produced a sprea dsheet detailing how the 
figures had been determined. 
 
16. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill 
of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the 
evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduct ion in the price of the contract 
from €263,093 to €260,726.81. 
 
17. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attribut able to this arithmetical error from 
the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a rev iew of the specifications. The 
review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€19 41.62 more than the stated 
contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities. 
 
18. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the 
specification review work, amounting to the differe nce between the original 
contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice pr ice of €289,028.74, giving a 
total of €25,935.57 for extra work. 
 
19. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Of ficial 2 in a further meeting with 
the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also co nfirmed that the extra work 
had not been recorded in written form, as it follow ed a visit to the construction site 
by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1.  
 
20. In summary, there are no documentary records to  support the extra works. The 
only financial documentation on file authorising th e extra works appears to be a 
signed schedule of payments, which includes the pro vision of €25,935.74 for 
extra works.  
 
Allegation 2 
(The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreem ent to proceed in spite of the 
fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation l imit of €25, 000 to sign and 
approve a contract which deviated from the normal p rocurement procedure under 
Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruc tion 1999/2 on Public 
Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds) ; 
and 
Allegation 3  
(Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the  Annex Agreement without any 
supporting documentation indicating either the natu re of the extra works or 
appropriate authorisation) 
 
21. A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Div isional Manager dated 21 
January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7  January 2003, indicates 
that an urgent request was made for construction of  a fire-fighters office and 
maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland tak ing over from Italy as “Lead 
Nation” in March 2003.  
 
22. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was si gned with the Vendor for 
construction of a fire-fighters office and maintena nce offices on 7 February 2003,  5 supported by a justification from the Divisional Ma nager also dated 7 February 
2003.  
 
23. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 rela ting to the annex agreement 
indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cos t of the contract. However, 
there are no documents in the contract file indicat ing the nature of the extra 
works or under what procedure they were authorised.   
 
24. When asked about the extra payment in interview , the Divisional Manager 
indicated that from the documents presented to him/ her (specifically the contract 
file) he/she could not say what the extra works wer e. He/she added that without 
looking at the works covered by the contract he/she  could not know whether or 
not there was any provision for extra expenditure. 
 
25. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra pay ment in interview stated that 
he/she would have to check airport administration r ecords and provide this 
information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF 
at which he/she indicated that the extra work relat ed to a request from KFOR for 
a stair rail and the creation of a storage space un der the stairs of the training 
offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, tog ether with office partitioning for 
the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/ she produced a copy of a 
manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 Septembe r 2004, drawn up by the 
Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carr ied out. This indicates that 
there was no supporting documentation for the extra  work when it was carried 
out. The only financial documentation on file autho rising the extra works appears 
to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes  the provision of €1,390 for 
extra works.  
 
Allegation 4 
(It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed t o secure funding approval prior to 
authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office 
and maintenance offices) 
 
26. A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 20 03 shows that the Divisional 
Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed i n spite of the fact that the 
contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €2 5,000. In addition, the 
document indicates that the work had already been c ompleted by the time that 
financial approval was sought for the expenditure. 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
 
27. There is no supporting documentation or appropr iate authorisation for the extra 
works in the sum of €25,935.74 arising from the mai n contract for the 
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services. This is 
contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administra tive Instruction 1999/2 on 
Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget  Funds. 
 
28.  The same is applicable to the extra works in t he sum of €1,390 relating to the 
Annex Agreement for construction of a fire-fighters  office and maintenance 
offices. This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of U NMIK Finance Administrative 
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget 
Funds.  6  
29. In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed 
in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his /her authorisation limit of 
€25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviat ed from the normal 
procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Fi nance Administrative 
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget 
Fund. 
 
30. Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval 
prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agre ement to construct a fire-
fighters office and maintenance offices. This is co ntrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK 
Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public  Procurement using Kosovo 
Consolidated Budget Funds.   
 
31. In mitigation, the construction of a fire-fight ers office and maintenance offices do 
appear to have been required as a matter of urgency . 
 
 
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
32. The ITF recommends the following; 
 
Given that the Divisional Manager has left the Miss ion and cannot be sanctioned for 
his/her actions, it is recommended that UNMIK (Pill ar IV) should place a copy of this 
report on his/her personnel file for future referen ce. (IV04/276/01) 
 
It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropr iate action against ATCS 
Official 2 as the official having responsibility fo r the ATCS for his/her failure to ensure 
that the extra work was adequately documented and a uthorised. (IV04/277/02)

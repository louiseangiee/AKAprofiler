I.  INTRODUCTION  
 
1. In October 2003, the Investigations Division of Office of Internal Oversight Services 
(ID/OIOS) received information that in May 2003 UNON/ ITS Staff Member, a staff member in 
the Information Technology Service of the United Nat ions Office in Nairobi (UNON/ITS), 
solicited and obtained Ksh 22,250 (US$294.70) with the promise to extend a New York tie-line 
satellite connection from the United Nations Politic al Office for Somalia (UNPOS) to the 
residence of the Representative of the Secretary Ge neral. Given the low priority of this case, it 
was investigated when time and resources permitted.  The investigation is now complete.

III.  METHODOLOGY  
 
3.  ID/OIOS reviewed documents relevant to the inve stigation and researched pertinent 
United Nations rules and regulations as well as loca l laws. ID/OIOS also interviewed witnesses 
in UNON, UNPOS and UNDP offices in Nairobi.  
 
 
IV.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
4.  UNPOS is a mission set up by the Department of P olitical Affairs (DPA) and is headed 
by a Representative of the Secretary General (RSG).  UNPOS is based at the UNON compound 
in Gigiri, Kenya and receives common services suppo rt from UNON.  
 
 
V. INVESTGATIVE DETAILS 
 
5. ID/OIOS interviewed various members of the UNPOS sta ff who provided the following 
information.  The UNPOS Official wished to extend th e New York tie-line satellite connection 
from the RSG office to the RSG residence.  His/her staff located the UNON/ITS Staff Member  who 
said s/he could provide the connection with the pur chase of a few items of equipment.  UNPOS 
requested, on 15 May 2003, that a cheque for Kshs 2 2,250 be issued to the UNON/ITS Staff 
Member for this purpose, which s/he cashed.  Howeve r, s/he never provided the service, nor did 
s/he return the money when asked.  On 27 August 200 3 the UNPOS Official’s administrative 
assistant made a formal request to the UNON Official for the installation and on 7 October 2003 
a letter from UNPOS signed by the UNPOS Official to t he UNON Official alleged that the 
UNON/ITS Staff Member had promised this service, rec eived payment but had not provided the 
service or returned the money. 
 
6. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON/ITS Staff Member, who c laimed that his/her verbal 
proposal to UNPOS was that s/he would prepare the eq uipment for the satellite link, but that 
installation was to be carried out by a licensed co mpany.  S/he said that the payment to him/her 
was only for preparation of the equipment.  S/he ex plained that his/her advice that the satellite 
connection was possible was based on his/her projec ted use of required equipment that was lying 
unused in the UNON workshop.  However, s/he did not g et approval for the use of this 
equipment at the time of his/her proposal from his/ her supervisor, the UNON Official, who was 
on leave.  When s/he did speak to the UNON Official, s/he was told that the equipment could not 
be used by UNPOS and that UNPOS should initiate a pr ocurement procedure for the job or 
arrange to purchase and install the equipment itsel f.  The UNON/ITS Staff Member gave this 
information to the UNPOS Official’s administrative a ssistant.  S/he told ID/OIOS that s/he was 
willing to refund the money, but had not done so. 
  
7. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON Official.  S/he stated that upon receipt of the formal 
request for installation of the satellite link, s/h e informed UNPOS that the equipment required 
would cost $11,560.  S/he told ID/OIOS that the pro per procedure to obtain this link required 
UNPOS to make a formal request to his/her office an d, after its approval, a procurement process 
would take place.  Due to limitations of staff and a lack of licensing authority, UNON/IT could   play an advisory role, but the company that won the  bid would provide equipment and 
installation. 
   
8. The UNON Official also told ID/OIOS said s/he had not  known of the UNON/ITS Staff 
Member’s initiative until after s/he received UNPOS’  formal request for the satellite link. After 
receipt of the UNPOS Official’s letter of 7 October 2003, s/he referred the matter to the UNON 
Security and Safety Unit for investigation. 
   
 
VI. FINDINGS 
 
9. UNPOS attempted to achieve an extension of the satel lite link from its office to the 
residence of the RSG.  A verbal arrangement was mad e with the UNON/ITS Staff Member and 
payment arranged for him/her of Ksh 22,250.   
 
10. While the UNON/ITS Staff Member claimed that s/he to ld UNPOS that s/he was using 
the money to purchase equipment to repair a power s upply for the project and that installation 
would have to be carried out by a licensed company,  UNPOS’ claim that the agreement was that 
the UNON/ITS Staff Member was to handle the entire pr oject for this sum is supported by the 
evidence. 
   
11. The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expens ive equipment from the UNON 
workshop, but did not receive permission to do so f rom his/her supervisor prior to his/her 
arrangement with UNPOS.  When the UNON Official learne d of these arrangements, s/he told 
the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for 
extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels. 
 
12. UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the 
UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
13. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, receiving 
money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money 
paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted con trary to his/her obligations under Staff 
Regulation 1.2 
 
14. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, the 
UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obli gations under The Financial Regulations 
and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regul ation 5.12.
